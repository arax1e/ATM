# ATM
## About the Project
This app creates a virtual ATM that allows the user to make deposits and withdrawals and keep track of their account balance. 

## How to Use
To use this app, you can download the files onto your machine and run them from a local server. The main code is run through the standalone.html page.

## Future Improvements
I would like to work on improving the ATM's UI, and making it so that the input field doesn't come up until you select a deposit or withdrawal. 

## License 
This app is made with files from MIT x Pro's Professional Certificate in Web Development course. More information can be found in the LICENSE file.
